# kotlin-spring-boot-playground

This is a bootstrap of Kotlin generated with [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/). My main goal is to use it as a playground and gain a deeper understanding of Kotlin and Spring Boot / Spring Cloud / Spring Cloud Data Flow.

I will add here from time to time different implementations of functionality which Spring delivers and use this project as an reference for my future projects.
