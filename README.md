# kotlin-spring-boot-playground

This is a bootstrap of Kotlin generated with [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/). My main goal is to use it as a playground and gain a deeper understanding of Kotlin and Spring Boot / Spring Cloud / Spring Cloud Data Flow.

I will add here from time to time different implemenations of functionality which Spring delivers and use this project as an reference for my future projects.

The master branch will allways include all features. If an specific implemenatiton is searched, it will be can find in the specific feature branch like feature/mongodb.

# Roadmap
